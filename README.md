Conclusion:
It's the hexacode of an ELF file.

Problems arised while training:

1) The dataset doesn't have the number mark. After trying on some examples, I found out that the model predicted it as letter 'Y', so if an 'Y' appears before a letter from 'A' to 'I', i will interprete it as number from 0 to 9 respectively. It seems inaccurate if it's actually an 'Y' but works well in this case.

2) Each characters in the image is not equally divided. Therefore, I have to adjust first few characters in each line to make the model predict accurate.

3) Starting a new session will affect the result. The first day, I trained the model and it predicted relatively accurate. But the day after, I trained again with the same model and the result I got is completely different. After that, I tried restarting session and it worked like the first day.
